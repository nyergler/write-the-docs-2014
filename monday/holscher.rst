Welcome to Write the Docs

Write the Docs is a community conference; this means it isn't about
profit, it's about getting people in a room to communicate with each
other.

This is version 1.0; last year was version 0, we did one in Budapest,
sponsored by Prezi (it didn't count for versioning). Budapest was
amazing, and there was a lightning talk involving bag pipes at 3pm in
someone's office (apparently they were cool).

Oh yeah, we still don't know what we're doing.

Your job: make friends, learn something, have fun. You're sitting at
round tables, so now you have friends. We get along with one another
by being welcoming, open, supportive, and positive. This is a
professional conference for many of you, but it's also about building
a commmunity.

The agenda today is wide-ranging, and documentarian bound. There are
writers, project managers, and developers here, and we hope everyone
will be stretched in at least one direction.

This year there's dedicated space for the "hallway track", on the
second floor. It's free space in the morning if you just want to get
away, and after lunch there will be a couple talks, and then
"unconference".
