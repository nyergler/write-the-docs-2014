Technical writer and instructional designer, and a practicing permie.
[Lots of people konw what that is, but I have no clue.] Over the past
three years he's replaced his lawn with a food forest, and
signle-sourced training and documentation materials for a long term
project with California Dept of Corrections.

Permaculture was first described by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren
in 1978 and 1988. Permaculture is a philosophy of "working with,
rather than against, nature"; "protracted and thoughtful observation"
of systems to see how they evolve. "The solutions are embarassingly
simple".

Examples:

* Lawns
* Gardens
* Greening a desert near Sea of Galilea
* Christensen's food forest
* City Repair: Portland based group reclaiming neighborhood public
  intersections to build community

Principles:

* Work with the elements
* Diversity gives stability
* The problem is the solution
* Make the least change for th greatest effect
* No limit ot the richness of design

Documentation is ripe for this: you want to develop a system that can
will be easily maintained and fruitful for those who come after you.

* Observe
* Design
* Evolve

Observation always comes first, and is about receiving information and
understanding the environment around you. You observe without
preconceived ideas, and with an open mind. If you feel like something
is missing, you observe some more.

When you're observing a project, you also need to observe the
surrounding environemnt. What's the corporate culture? What's the
duration? What's the desired outcome/yield? Who's available, and what
are their skills, abilities and natural inclinations? How can things
in the environment (the land, the people, etc) be combined for the
most beneficial outcome?

Design is where most of the work actually takes place. What are the
zones of access? What's the smallest change that will creat the
largest effect? And what direction are energies going in? It's easier
to work with the flow than against it. In permaculture, the edge --
where the forest meets the plain, the plain meets the ocean -- is
where the action is; there's nutrient exchange, there's biodiversity.
So when we think about applying these principles to projects and
documentation, think about where the edges are between different
people roles, etc. If you can increase the size of your edge, you can
increase the diversity on your project.

"The importance of collaborative porcesses is often ignored because of
the urgnecy of direct action." -- Telford

And the process has to evolve to continue to be successful. Observing
lessons learned, measuring and evaluting outcomes, etc. What are the
documentation *opportunities*?
