**Or, what can we learn about writing from our programmer friends.**

When Vyedin was in college, she did really well on her first paper.
And when she went to write the second, she blocked at the blank page.
Now she works for Xamarin, and when you create a new app using their
tool, you get boilerplate and guidance about what to do next. What if
you didn't have to start with a blank page when you're starting a
document?

*Don't start with a blank page.*

Create a template for each type of document you write, and put them in
the same place, so you never have to start with a blank page.

*Make a spec*

While mentoring a new writer through a document, Nina realized that
she and the new writer thought the document was answering different
questions. So you can write a simple spec for your doc, that keeps
everyone involved on the same page.

* What question is this document meant to answer?
* Who is the target audience?
* What's the current state of the documentation on this topic?
* What's the work plan?

Programmers also have design patterns: pre-established architectural
patterns for software. Documentarians have that, too, and you can use
those to make the work easier.

*Writing for Clarity: Name your variables*

Most programming texts contain a section on naming variables. Writing
needs this, too. There are things like the undefined "if", a lack of
ownership (passive voice), vague terms ("view", "component", etc), or
ideas whose name changes over time, all of which make your writing
less clear. Be specific, and be precise.

*Editing*

Editing isn't just about correcting spelling or punctuation. Editing
is the refactoring of writing. Editing should be about rearranging,
restructing, and clarifying what's going on in a document. (Just make
sure you're not changing the question.) You don't have to be an expert
to be a good editor (although it helps); you just need to be willing to
ask questions.
