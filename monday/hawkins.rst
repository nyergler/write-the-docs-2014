"Writing documentation by learning as you go."

We usually think about ignorance as the enemy, something that we want
to overcome using documentation. But it's when we have that struggle
ourselves, we're in a good position to understand what users need to
know.

Hawkins graduated in May, and started working in August. In college,
she was the lead TA for an Intro to CS course, and worked on hiring
approximately 30 TAs for the course. What she discovered was that the
best TAs weren't always they students who effortlessly got A's; the
ones that had to work hard to get their B often understood the
struggles of incoming students better.

When Hawkins started working at Mongo in August, she was enthusiastic,
ignorant, and not much else, and there was > 1MM lines of code to
understand. A lack of internal documentation makes scaling the team
more difficult.

So after she figured out the problem in front of her (via a
conversation with the CTO), she wanted to share what she'd learned.
She talked to the documentation head, who suggested: write anything,
even if it's wrong. Because even if it's wrong, people now have
something to respond to and critique.

And people responded positively: "Wow, I didn't know about that,
that's helpful." "I'm so glad someone wrote about this. Someone should
also write about X, Y, and Z." So you need to find your allies, and
help spread the work around.
