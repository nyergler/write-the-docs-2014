Worked on reviving volunteer documentation wiki with a little social
engineering and friendliness. The wiki for years had an outdated
tagline, and didn't link to the great content that was actually there.
Now it contains explicit call-outs to getting started, beginner
information, and entry points that people coming to the community may
be interested in.

Britta joined Cydia as a community manager, and tried to push
engineers towards updating the wiki. After getting involved in Open
Hatch, she realized that she actually *did* have something to
contribute to the wiki and to the documentation.
